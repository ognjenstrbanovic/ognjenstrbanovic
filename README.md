### Hello there 👋, you can call me Ogi!

#### Fairly recently, in the summer of 2020, I proudly graduated from Rutgers' Data Science Bootcamp... 🎓

#### I'm currently working towards landing my first full-time job as a technologist/data practitioner... 👨‍💻

#### In the meantime, I'm very excited to announce that I've become a Fintech/Data Viz tutor as of December 2020!

#### Blockchain, covered in the FinTech program, is a very  groundbreaking technology with a lot more use than just in cryptocurrency! I'm excited to learn more.

#### Also, right now, I am reading a Manning publication called "Tiny Python Projects" (it helps keep me in *Pythonic* shape 🐍😀).

### Lastly, please feel free to email me if you would like to chat about anything at all! 📧 Email is to the left (in my bio)!
